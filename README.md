## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm [Ryan Warrener](https://warrenwarrens.github.io/), a fourth year Computer Science student at Ontario Tech, Oshawa, Canada

I love working with mobile development, and front end design/development. 

Outside of work, you'll find me bouldering, working out at the gym, playing (mainly) single player games or out with friends
